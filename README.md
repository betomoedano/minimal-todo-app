## Hello my friend!

This is a to-do app project made using React Native Expo, I know what you are thinking,
this is just a simple to-do app but this one is different!
let me explain:

- This app has a unique, simple, and beautiful design, made carefully by the Eco Studios design team. Here is the design if you want to play with it. 👉🏼 [Design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1072981172023301059/TODO-App).
- Easy app navigation, users can add tasks just by pressing the "+" button
- Push notifications, this app allows users to set an alert for any task
- Filter to-do list, by default the tasks are filtered by today and tomorrow but additionally, you can apply another filter to hide the completed tasks.
- finally this cool app allows users to mark tasks as completed or incompleted in a user-friendly way.

## Dependencies

```
expo install expo-notifications

expo install expo-constants

yarn add @react-native-community/datetimepicker

yarn add @react-navigation/native-stack

yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit redux react-redux

yarn add moment
```

## Conclusion

As you can see after mentioning all the features that this app has it does not seem very simple anymore.
That is why I think this is a great project for someone who is starting learning React Native because it can help to learn how to manage state,
navigation, how to display data, push notifications, and more! 🤯
